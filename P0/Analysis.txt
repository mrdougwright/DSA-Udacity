Analysis using Big O Notation

Task0
With each function accessing a specific item in the array
using an index or negative one, each function performs only
on operation, regardless of input size (n).
O(0n + 1) + O(0n + 1)
O(0n + 2)

Answer:
O(1)
---------------

Task1
This task uses one main function, combining texts and calls into
one array of records (operation 1). We create a set (operation 2)
and begin looping over our records. Inside the loop we perform 4
operations and finally return the length. Our final Big O is then
O(1n + 6), simplified to O(n).

Answer:
O(n)
---------------

Task2
Since the second for loop only looks at a max of 2 numbers (info[0:2]),
this function is not exactly n^2, since only the first n is dependent
on input size. Total operations outside the loop: 3. Operations inside
the loop: 6. Our notation is thus O(1n + 9) or simply O(n).

Answer:
O(n)
---------------

Task3
Counting operations we get 15. We loop over our input twice, but also
perform a sort operation. So our Big O notation might look like
O(2n + 15) + O(n log n), simplified to O(n log n).

Answer:
O(n log n)
---------------

Task 4
With 7 operations, 4 for loops and 1 python sort operation (n log n),
our notation might look like: O(4n + 7) + O(n log n). Simplified to
O(n log n).

Answer:
O(n log n)
